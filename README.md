# Twitter-Sentiments-Analysis


Overview:

This project performs Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models to analyze sentiments based on textual data.


Features:

âœ” Collects tweets via Twitter API (or uses pre-existing datasets)

âœ” Cleans and preprocesses text (removes stopwords, punctuation, etc.)

âœ” Implements NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, etc.)

âœ” Uses multiple Machine Learning models (e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

âœ” Visualizes sentiment distribution and word frequencies



Technologies Used:


Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, TextBlob, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Models: NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Notebook: Jupyter Notebook


Installation & Setup:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Twitter-Sentiments-Analysis.git

cd Twitter-Sentiments-Analysis

Step 2: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Jupyter Notebook-jupyter notebook

Open sentiment_analysis.ipynb and run the cells.


Dataset:

You can use a pre-collected Twitter dataset from Kaggle or scrape tweets using the Twitter API.

Example Columns in Dataset:

tweet_id: Unique ID for the tweet

text: The content of the tweet

sentiment: Label (Positive, Negative, Neutral)


Model Performance:

Model	Accuracy:

NaÃ¯ve Bayes	85%

Logistic Regression	88%

Random Forest	90%


Usage:

Social Media Monitoring: Understand public sentiment about topics.

Brand Analysis: Track customer opinions about products/services.

Political Sentiment: Analyze people's opinions on political events.


Future Improvements:

ðŸš€ Fine-tune models using Deep Learning (LSTMs, BERT)
ðŸš€ Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
ðŸš€ Integrate real-time Twitter API for live sentiment tracking
